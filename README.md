### Swagger-ui
This api has swagger-php comments. To generate them go the the root directory and run:

```vendor/bin/swagger http/api/index.php -o path/to/swagger.json```

You will then generate the swagger.json for this project, which you can then use with swagger-ui which you will need to set up yourself.
